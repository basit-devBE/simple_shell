# Mohammed Basit Abdul&  Aria's ALX Shell Project

Welcome to our Shell Project! This project, developed by Mohammed Basit Abdul and Atandoh Aria, is a command-line shell implementation built as part of our coursework at ALX Software Engineering School. The ALX Shell Project aims to provide a user-friendly and efficient shell environment for executing commands and managing a variety of tasks.

## Features

- **Command Execution**: Our ALX Shell allows users to execute various commands, such as file manipulation, directory navigation, process management, and more.
- **Built-in Commands**: We have implemented several built-in commands, including `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`, `echo`, and `exit`, to provide convenient and essential functionalities.
- **Redirection and Piping**: Our shell supports input/output redirection and command piping, enabling users to manipulate and combine command outputs effectively.
- **Background Processes**: Users can run commands in the background by appending the `&` symbol, allowing for concurrent execution of tasks.
- **Signal Handling**: Our ALX Shell properly handles signals like `Ctrl+C` and `Ctrl+Z` to ensure a smooth user experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with Our ALX Shell Project, follow the steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/alx-shell-project.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   $ cd alx-shell-project
   ```

3. Compile the source code:
   ```
   $ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o alxshell
   ```

4. Run the ALX Shell:
   ```
   $ ./alxshell
   ```

## Usage

Once inside our ALX Shell, you can start executing commands as you would in a regular shell environment. Use the provided built-in commands or any other commands available in your system.

Here are a few examples:

- Changing the directory:
  ```
  $ cd directory-name
  ```

- Listing files and directories:
  ```
  $ ls
  ```

- Printing the current working directory:
  ```
  $ pwd
  ```

- Redirecting command output to a file:
  ```
  $ ls > output.txt
  ```

- Piping commands:
  ```
  $ ls | grep shell
  ```

For a complete list of available commands and their usage, please refer to the project documentation.
